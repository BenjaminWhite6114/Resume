                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>I was first introduced to programming in middleschool when my friends would program their own game onto their casio calculators and I wanted to join in on the fun. In highscool I was introduced to java by my Advanced computer math class, and went on to take AP computer science. I still loved making games, and spent a lot of my free time in highschool watching videos about game design, making games in the ledwerks and unity engines, and making games with my friends.</p>
                        <p>I went into college intending to study game design, and so took several classes geared toward that subject, including how to code for games, make music for games, and about using game engines. Though I'd switch to studying philosophy, I later decided to do a coding bootcamp with Altcademy on full stack webdevelopment.</p>

                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>While I beleive I always had a philisophical impulse, I wasn't formally introduced to the subject until college. I owe my decision to switch to philosophy to who I would consider to be my mentor, and the intro level religious studies class I took with him. Though I only took the one class with him, we founded the George Mason Socratic Society together. His genuine love of deep discussion and his dedication to his students inspired me then, and continues to inspire me to this day.</p>

                        <h3>Socratic Society</h3>
                        <p>Socratic Society was a club dedicated to socratic discussion of topics ranging from semantics, to metaphysics, to theology. I was a founding member, and quickly took on the responsibilty of organizing the meetings and leading the discussions. During quarintine I moved the club online to a dedicated discord server, and we continued to do meetings in a hybrid style after quarintine ended.</p>

                        <h3>Trasferable skills</h3>
                        <p>Many of my most valuable skills come from studying and discussing philosophy. In socratic society, I learned a lot not just about leading a group, but also about communicating about topics which by there very nature are difficult to talk about. To have a productive conversation about such complex and intangible things requires one to be able to quickly understand wolrdviews vastly different from your own and to figure out how to bridge gaps in understanding on such basic levels as what it even means for something to be real.
                        Studying philosophy in general require similar mental flexibility and swiftness in learning.</p>
                        <!--Maybe cut this line \/-->
                        <p>In addition to the skills I've learned, the content of my studies may be more relevant that most would realize. Not only does philosophy underpin all of academia, in almost every field it is its source. There was a time when being a philosopher qualified one to be a professor of any subject, as it was seen as the root of all other studies, hence a Doctorate is abreviated PHD.</p>
